Project: Modern Airbnb Homepage Clone
This repository contains a front-end project that recreates and enhances the homepage of Airbnb. The project's main objective was to demonstrate proficiency in core web development technologies by building a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface without relying on external libraries or frameworks.It's not just a static page, it's a dynamic experience.

Features:
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and mobile-first, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes from large desktops to small mobile devices.
Dynamic UI Elements:
Dark Mode Toggle: A user-friendly button that switches the entire site between a light and dark theme. The user's preference is saved in localStorage.
Wishlist Functionality: Users can click the heart icon on any listing card to toggle its "liked" state.
Filter Modal: A functional modal popup that appears when the "Filters" button is clicked, demonstrating how to handle overlays and interactive components.
Visual Enhancements: The design includes smooth CSS animations on card load and interactive hover effects on buttons and images to improve the user experience.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For creating a semantic and accessible page structure.
CSS3: For all styling, including responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid, custom animations, and pseudo-classes for hover effects.
JavaScript: Used to handle all the dynamic features and user interactions, demonstrating core programming skills.
